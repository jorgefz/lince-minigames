# Version History

Version codes follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## To-Do
- Update minigames to be compatible with v0.8
- Formalize process to make custom games work with lince
- Add minimal empty example in minigames repo
- Improve user guide and clean docs folder

- Rename `LinceBeginScene` and `LinceEndScene` to e.g. `LinceBeginDraw` and `LinceEndDraw`.
- Merge all key events into single struct. Add 'mods' to keys (e.g. Ctrl)
- Move misc functions to separate files (`LinceReadFile`, `LinceGetTimeMillis`). 
- Change entity registry initialisation to take an array of component sizes instead of a list of varargs.
- Nuklear UI wrapper and/or custom docs.
- Create functions that don't depend on OpenGL, e.g. `LinceImage` for storing image data, `LinceClock` for timers, etc. 


## v0.8.0
- Added CMocka as the testing framework.
- Added UUIDs.
- Added z-sorting with translucency by sorting sprites before drawing
- Added scene system.
- Improved premake scripts. Placed separate 'premak5.lua' scripts in the folder of each project with all build commands necessary to build it. This allows users to create projects that depend on Lince much more easily.
- Added rudimentary asset manager. Assets are now sought from a stack of asset folders, whose locations are defined relative to the path of the running executable. This allows the executable to find the application assets when called from anywhere in the system.
- `LINCE_DIR` now generated in premake5 file automatically from any path.
- Changed scope of `LINCE_DIR` to the directory where output files are generated (e.g. logging, profiling). By default, this is the location from which the executable is called.
- Added functions to initialise camera without allocating heap memory.
- Improved error message when font fails to load
- Removed `LinceCreateTexture`
- Removed `name` parameter from `LinceTexture` functions.
- Removed `name` parameter from `LinceShader` functions.
- Change naming of event-related variable names from past tense (e.g. pressed) to present tense (.e.g press), and shortened "mouse button" to simply "mouse". This affects `LinceEventType` enum values, `LinceEventData` union members, event struct names, and event creation functions.
- Renamed application callback variables e.g. from `game_on_update` to `on_update`.
- Fixed bug where passing a NULL value as the filename for the log file would result in undefined behaviour.
- Added functions to open and close a profiling file, instead of providing a file handle directly.
- Added logging platform name in log file.
- Renamed `LINCE_STR_MAX` to `LINCE_TEXT_MAX`.
- Renamed function `LinceGetAppState` to `LinceGetApp`.
- Replaced instances of standard C functions `malloc`,`calloc`,`realloc`, and `free` with the engine versions.
- Renamed premake5 script variables `OutputDir` to `LinceOutputDir`, and `IncludeDir` to `LinceIncludeDir`.
- Fixed bug in editor where entity registry was initalised with the wrong number of components.
- Added 'clean' action to premake5 that removes build outputs
- Fixed comaptibility with Windows by enforcing old MSVC preprocessor
- Fixed minimum required OpenGL version to 4.5.
- Renamed layer callbacks following snake case.
- Moved input code, and key and mouse codes to 'input' folder
- Improved layer stack to be more cache friendly. From array of pointers to array of plain layers.
- Added `fileio.h` functions for file IO: `LinceIsDir`, `LinceIsFile`, `LinceLoadFile`, and `LinceLoadTextFile.`
- Removed `LinceGetTimeMillis`.
- Added to-screen transform and improved to-world transform.

- Updated README with instructions for audio playing on WSLg and required OpenGL version

## v0.5.0
- Added basic audio API
- Integrated miniaudio into the engine
- Restructured build scripts to output binaries to common top-level folders `bin` and `obj`.
- Moved output build files to `build` folder.
- Separated nuklear and stb\_image to their own projects that build to a static library.
- Separated `game` project into `editor` and `sandbox` projects.


## v0.4.2
- Added benchmarking and profiling tools in Python
- Added basic test framework
- Added hashmap, array, and linked list containers
- Added caching of shader uniform locations with hashmap


## v0.4.1
- Added function `LinceLoadTexture`, similar to `LinceCreateTexture` but with extra `flags` argument.
- Added texture flag to flip texture data vertically on load `LinceTexture_FlipY`.
- Updated docs
- Fixed bug where Nuklear would respond to all scrolling events, even if no widget was active.
- Embedded the renderer's shader source in the code, and removed the source files.


## v0.4.0
- Added simple tilemaps - `LinceTilemap`
- Simplified premake5 script somewhat
- Refactored Missile Command debug text as a movable and minimizable Nuklear window, as the text boxes where consuming the click events
- Added memory management functions: LinceMalloc, LinceNewCopy, etc
- Added allocation macros allowing for custom allocation functions - `LINCE_MALLOC`, `LINCE_CALLOC`, `LINCE_REALLOC`, and `LINCE_FREE`
- Added `LinceForeach` macro for iterating over array items
- Added calculation for z-order based on the y coordinate `LinceYSortedZ`

- Rebuilt html docs

## v0.2.0
- Added basic tile animations

## v0.1.0 (alpha)
