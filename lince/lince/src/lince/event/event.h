/** @file event.h
Events are generated when a certain action is executed,
either by the user or by the application.
Examples are mouse button clicks, key strokes, mouse movement, and window resizing.
Every time an event takes place, a callback function is called
and a `LinceEvent` object is generated and propagated through the engine.
If set, your game will receive this events through a custom `OnEvent` function
via the `on_event` callback.

Events are first passed to the application's `on_event`
and then to the OnEvent callbacks of each of the overlays and layers.
