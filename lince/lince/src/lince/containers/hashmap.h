/** @file hashmap.h
* `hashmap.h` is an implementation of a dictionary, which is data structure that holds
* key-value pairs, using a hashmap.
* Hash collisions are handled using linked lists on each bucket.
* 
* Example code:
* ```c
*     hashmap_t map;
*     hashmap_init(&map, 5); // initial expected size
* 
*     int x = 10;
*     float y = 0.016;
* 
*     hashmap_set(&map, "integer", &x);
*     hashmap_set(&map, "floating", &y);
* 
*     int a = *(int*)hashmap_get(&map, "integer");
*     float b = *(floating*)hashmap_get(&map, "floating");
*     
*     assert(x == a);
*     assert(y == b);
* 
*     hashmap_uninit(&map); // does not free stored values
* ```
