/*

`hashmap.h` is an implementation of a dictionary, which is data structure that holds
key-value pairs, using a hashmap.
Hash collisions are handled using linked lists on each bucket.


Example code:

    hashmap_t map = hashmap_create(5); // initial expected size

    int x = 10;
    float y = 0.016;

    hashmap_set(&map, "integer", &x);
    hashmap_set(&map, "floating", &y);

    int a = *(int*)hashmap_get(&map, "integer");
    float b = *(floating*)hashmap_get(&map, "floating");

    assert(x == a);
    assert(y == b);

    hashmap_free(&map); // does not free stored values
