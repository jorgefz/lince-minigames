/** @file audio.h

The audio library can manage two types of sounds.

- Buffered sounds are entirely loaded onto memory. Best for sounds shorter than 5 sec.
- Streamed sounds are simultaneously read and played. Best for music or sounds longer than 5 sec.

Example code:

```c

void OnInit(){
    LinceAudioEngine* audio_engine;
    LinceSoundManager* sound_manager;
    LinceSound *music;

    LinceSoundConfig sound_config = LinceGetDefaultSoundConfig();
    sound_config.volume = 0.5f;

    audio_engine = LinceCreateAudioEngine();
    sound_manager = LinceCreateSoundManager(audio_engine, "meow.wav");
    
    // -- play background music
    music = LinceLoadStream(audio_engine, "music.wav");
    music->config.volume = 0.3f;
    LinceUpdateSound(music);
    LincePlaySound(music);
}

void OnUpdate(){
    if( button_press(...) ){
        // Play a sound
        LinceSpawnSound(audio_engine, sound_manager, &sound_config);
    }
}

void OnTerminate(){
    LinceDeleteSoundManager(sound_manager);
    LinceDeleteSound(music);
    LinceTerminateAudioEngine(audio_engine);
}
