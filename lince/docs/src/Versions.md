### To-Do
- Refactored minigames and editor
- Move documentation and minigames to separate github repositories?


## v0.5.0
- Added basic audio API
- Integrated miniaudio into the engine
- Restructured build scripts to output binaries to common top-level folders `bin` and `obj`.
- Moved output build files to `build` folder.
- Separated nuklear and stb\_image to their own projects that build to a static library.
- Separated `game` project into `editor` and `sandbox` projects.


## v0.4.2
- Added benchmarking and profiling tools in Python
- Added basic test framework
- Added hashmap, array, and linked list containers
- Added caching of shader uniform locations with hashmap


## v0.4.1
- Added function `LinceLoadTexture`, similar to `LinceCreateTexture` but with extra `flags` argument.
- Added texture flag to flip texture data vertically on load `LinceTexture_FlipY`.
- Updated docs
- Fixed bug where Nuklear would respond to all scrolling events, even if no widget was active.
- Embedded the renderer's shader source in the code, and removed the source files.


## v0.4.0
- Added simple tilemaps - `LinceTilemap`
- Simplified premake5 script somewhat
- Refactored Missile Command debug text as a movable and minimizable Nuklear window, as the text boxes where consuming the click events
- Added memory management functions: LinceMalloc, LinceNewCopy, etc
- Added allocation macros allowing for custom allocation functions - `LINCE_MALLOC`, `LINCE_CALLOC`, `LINCE_REALLOC`, and `LINCE_FREE`
- Added `LinceForeach` macro for iterating over array items
- Added calculation for z-order based on the y coordinate `LinceYSortedZ`

## v0.3.1
- Renamed and moved the 2D renderer shader files to 'engine/assets/shaders'
- Updated premake5 lua script
- Moved Pong and Missile Command to their own projects and folders
- Solved bug in Missile Command where texture would be freed twice
- Updated docs

## v0.3.0
- Added calculation of inverse view-projection matrix on camera update.
- Added transform from screen to world coordinates.
- Added function to retrieve screen size directly.
- Added function to retrieve mouse position in world coordinates.
- Solved bug where Nuklear UI events were not being flagged as handled.
- Moved tile animation and tileset headers to 'tiles' folder.
- Added tile animation and tileset headers to `lince.h`.
- Renamed 'lince' folder to 'engine'.
- Added assertion to ensure fonts are correctly loaded from file.
- Moved engine source to 'lince' folder within 'engine/src'.
- Fixed bug in 2D renderer where quads that were no longer being rendered persisted in the scene.

## v0.2.2
- Improved tile animations with custom animation orders.
- Improved documentation on tile animations

## v0.2.1
- Renamed `LinceDeleteAnim` to `LinceDeleteTileAnim`
- LinceTileAnim: added optional maximum number of repeats
- LinceTileAnim: added `on_repeat` and `on_finish` callbacks
- Solved issue with test tilemap where black lines appear between tiles
- Rebuilt html docs

## v0.2.0
